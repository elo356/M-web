        <h2>Beyond the horizon</h1>
        <p>
         Since you entered my world, everything changed, </br>
         You brought hope and light that'll never fade. </br>
          You're my guiding star in the darkest night,</br>
         In just 5 days, our friendship takes flight.</br></br>
         
         You're the sunshine that brightens my way, </br>
         The melody that makes my heart sway. </br>
         With every word, with every smile,</br>
          I feel like we're singing a song worthwhile.</br></br>
         
         In every moment, though we've never met,</br>
         Your presence is felt, I'll never forget.</br>
         You're my guiding light, my constant support,</br>
         In this newfound friendship, I find comfort.</br></br>
         
         Though distance separates us, it's true, </br>
         You're the pillar of strength that helps me through. </br>
         Like a guiding light that leads the way, </br>
         Our friendship grows stronger every day.</br></br>
         
         
         You're the sunshine that brightens my way, </br>
         The melody that makes my heart sway.</br>
         With every word, with every smile, </br>
         I feel like we're singing a song worthwhile.</br></br>
         
         Thank you for being that special friend,</br>
          Though apart, our bond continues to shine. </br>
         In this journey we share, through thick and thin,</br>
         Our friendship grows, with love from within.</br></br>
