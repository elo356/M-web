         <h2>Five days of bliss</h1>
         <p>
         
          From the moment I first laid eyes on you,</br>
          I felt a love I never knew.</br>
          In just five days, you've become so dear,</br>
          Your presence brings me joy and cheer.</br></br>
          
          My heart is filled with love and delight,</br>
          You're a friend I hold so tight.</br>
          In just five days, it's plain to see,</br>
          You're a girl I genuinely adore, you mean so much to me.</br></br>
          
          It doesn't matter that it's only been a while,</br>
          In such a short time, I can't help but smile.</br>
          A connection so special, it feels so right,</br>
          You make me feel alive, you bring me light.</br></br>
          
          My heart is filled with love and delight,</br>
          You're a friend I hold so tight.</br>
          In just five days, it's plain to see,</br>
          You're a girl I genuinely adore, you mean so much to me.</br></br>
       
          I'm not sure what the future holds for us,</br>
          But in these five days, you've gained my trust.</br>
          I want you to know how much you mean,</br>
          In just a short time, you've become my queen.</br></br>
          
          My heart is filled with love and delight,</br>
          You're a friend I hold so tight.</br>
          In just five days, it's plain to see,</br>
          You're a girl I genuinely adore, you mean so much to me.</br></br>
          
          So here I am, expressing how I feel,</br>
          Hoping this friendship continues to seal.</br>
          Thank you for coming into my life so fast,</br>
          In just five days, I feel like I've known you in the past.</br></br>
