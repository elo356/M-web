        <h2>First laid</h1>
        <p>
        
From the moment I first laid eyes on you,</br>
A love so deep and true, it just grew.</br>
In just five days, you've captured my heart,</br>
Every moment with you feels like a work of art.</br></br>

My heart sings with joy, day and night,</br>
You're the one who makes everything feel right.</br>
In just five days, it's clear to see,</br>
You're the missing piece that completes my heart.</br></br>

Time may be short, but our bond is strong,</br>
With you, I feel like I truly belong.</br>
In just five days, you've become my muse,</br>
Every word, every melody, you infuse.</br></br>

My heart sings with joy, day and night,</br>
You're the one who makes everything feel right.</br>
In just five days, it's clear to see,</br>
You're the missing piece that completes my heart.</br></br>

The future holds promise, I can feel it near,</br>
In just five days, my doubts disappear.</br>
Our souls entwined, our dreams aligned,</br>
With you, my love, forever I'm bind.</br></br>

My heart sings with joy, day and night,</br>
You're the one who makes everything feel right.</br>
In just five days, it's clear to see,</br>
You're the missing piece that completes my heart.</br></br>

So here's to us, to our journey ahead,</br>
In just five days, a love story is spread.</br>
Thank you for bringing magic into my life,</br>
With you, my dear, I'll soar to new heights.</br></br>
